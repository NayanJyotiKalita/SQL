# Q. Manager left

## Context

In the dynamic environment of StarTech Solutions, employee management requires precise tracking of current employees and their reporting structures.
Itâ€™s crucial to identify situations where employees are left without active managers due to managerial turnover.
As a data analyst at StarTech Solutions, your manager has tasked you with generating a report that identifies employees whose salaries 
are below $15000 and who are currently reporting to managers who have left the company. This will help in reassigning these employees to active managers to ensure smooth operations.

## Problem Statement

Write a query to find the **employee_id** of the employees whose salary is strictly **less than** $15000 and whose manager left the company.
When a manager leaves the company, their information is deleted from the **employees** table, but the reporters still have their manager_id set to the manager that left.

## Result Requirements

- Return the column **'employee_id'**
- Return the result ordered by `employee_id` in ascending order.

**Table**: employees

select a.employee_id
from employees as a
left join employees as b

where a.salary < 15000 
and a.manager_id is not null
and b.employee_id is null
