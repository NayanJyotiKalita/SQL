# Q. Filter Products in Electronics Category

Consider a database schema for products with the following table:

**Products:** product_id (Integer, Primary Key),product_name (Text),category (Text),price (Integer)

Write an SQL query to retrieve products that belong to the **"Electronics"** category and have a price **greater than 500** or products that belong to the **"Apparel"** category and have a price **less than 50**.

Return the output ordered by **product_id** in **ascending order**.

## Answer (SQL Query)

FROM Products
WHERE (category = 'Electronics' AND price > 500)
   OR (category = 'Apparel' AND price < 50)
ORDER BY product_id;
