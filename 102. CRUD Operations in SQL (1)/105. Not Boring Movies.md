  - id is the primary key for this table.
  - Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
  - rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]

Write an SQL query to report the movies with an **odd-numbered ID** and **a description that is not "boring".**

Return the result table ordered by rating in **descending order** and id in **ascending order**.

***Note: Use the mod(column_name,number) function to find out an odd-numbered or even-numbered ID.***

FROM Cinema
WHERE MOD(id, 2) = 1 AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC, id ASC;
