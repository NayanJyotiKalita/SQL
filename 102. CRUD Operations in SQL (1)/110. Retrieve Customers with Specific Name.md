# Q. Retrieve Customers with Specific Name

Consider a database schema for customers with the following table:

**Customers:** customer_id (Integer, Primary Key) ,first_name (Text), last_name (Text), email (Text)

Write an SQL query to search for customers whose first name is "John" **or** last name is "Smith," and full name **is not** ‘John Smith’.

Return the output ordered by customer_id in ascending order.

**Sample Input:**
**Table: Customers**

**Sample Output:**

<img width="378" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43a425ab-208e-414e-9244-dd8082a97a7f" />

## Answer (SQL Query)

```sql
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email
FROM Customers
WHERE (first_name = 'John' AND last_name <>'Smith')
   OR  (first_name <> 'John'  AND  last_name ='Smith')
ORDER BY customer_id;
