---
  
## Objective:

---

## Instructions:
Task: Create a Shell Script for Automated Backups

Write a shell script that:
Connects to the MySQL server and performs a backup of the specified database "test".
Saves the backup file in the secure directory /home/user/secure/backup.
Appends the current date (in ddmmyyyy format) to the backup filename to help identify the backup date.
The backup file should be named using the format ${DB_NAME}_ddmmyyyy.sql, where DB_NAME is "test".

## Answer: 

```shell

#!/bin/bash

# Variables
DB_NAME="test"  # Set your database name here
BACKUP_DIR="/home/user/secure/backup"
DATE=$(date +%d%m%Y)  # Get current date in ddmmyyyy format
BACKUP_FILE="$DB_NAME"_"$DATE".sql
MYSQL_USER="root"  # Replace with your MySQL user
MYSQL_PASSWORD="user@123!"  # Replace with your MySQL password

# Check if backup directory exists, if not, create it
if [ ! -d "$BACKUP_DIR" ]; then
    mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
fi

# Function to perform MySQL backup
backup_database() {
    echo "Starting backup of database $DB_NAME..."
    mysqldump -u "$MYSQL_USER" -p"$MYSQL_PASSWORD" "$DB_NAME" > "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE"
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Backup was successful."
        chmod 600 "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_FILE"  # Secure the backup file
    else
        echo "Error during backup!"
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Call the backup function
backup_database
