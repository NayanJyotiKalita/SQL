Objective:
Create a shell script to manage user roles in MySQL by checking and revoking roles assigned to users.

Instructions:
Task: Create a Shell Script for Role Management
Write a shell script file named role_management_script.sh
User Verification and Creation: Checks if the user "Alice" exists in the database. If not, it creates this user with a predefined password.
Role Verification and Creation: Checks if the role "data_entry" exists. If not, the script creates this role.
Role Assignment: Assigns the "data_entry" role to "Alice" and refreshes database privileges to ensure the changes take effect immediately.
You need to use some predefined values inside you script:

Username:
"Alice"
Role Name:
"data_entry"
MySQL Credentials:
Username (MYSQL_USER):
"root"
Password (MYSQL_PASSWORD):
"user@123!"
Host (MYSQL_HOST):
"localhost"

```shell

#!/bin/bash

# MySQL Credentials and Configuration
MYSQL_USER="root"
MYSQL_PASSWORD="user@123!"
MYSQL_HOST="localhost"

# User and Role Configuration
USER_NAME="Alice"
USER_PASSWORD="user@123!" # Define Alice's password here
ROLE_NAME="data_entry"

# MySQL command prefix
MYSQL_CMD="mysql -h${MYSQL_HOST} -u${MYSQL_USER} -p${MYSQL_PASSWORD}"

echo "Starting user and role management script..."

# --- User Verification and Creation ---
echo "Checking if user '${USER_NAME}' exists..."
# Execute a query to check for the user. Note: Using -N -s -s to suppress headers and extra output.
USER_EXISTS=$(${MYSQL_CMD} -N -s -e "SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM mysql.user WHERE user = '${USER_NAME}');")

if [ "$USER_EXISTS" = "0" ]; then
    echo "User '${USER_NAME}' does not exist. Creating user..."
    # Note: Using 'localhost' as the host for Alice. Change if needed.
    ${MYSQL_CMD} -e "CREATE USER '${USER_NAME}'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '${USER_PASSWORD}';"
    echo "User '${USER_NAME}' created successfully."
else
    echo "User '${USER_NAME}' already exists."
fi

# --- Role Verification and Creation ---
# Note: CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS is available in MySQL 8.0+
# For older versions, you might need a different check.
echo "Checking/Creating role '${ROLE_NAME}'..."
${MYSQL_CMD} -e "CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS '${ROLE_NAME}';"
echo "Role '${ROLE_NAME}' ensured to exist."

# --- Role Assignment ---
echo "Assigning role '${ROLE_NAME}' to user '${USER_NAME}'@'localhost'..."
${MYSQL_CMD} -e "GRANT '${ROLE_NAME}' TO '${USER_NAME}'@'localhost';"

# --- Refresh Privileges ---
echo "Refreshing privileges..."
${MYSQL_CMD} -e "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;"

echo "Script finished."
