# Q. Olympic Table

### Context:
The Olympic Games are a major international multi-sport event where athletes from various countries compete for medals in different sports. 
The performance of each country is often evaluated based on the total number of medals won.

### Problem Statement:
In the context of managing data for an Olympic event, you are tasked with sorting a table of countries based on their medal counts. 
The goal is to determine the ranking of countries by their performance in the Olympics, prioritizing **gold, silver,** and **bronze** medals, respectively.

Write an SQL query that sorts the olympic table according to the following rules:

  - The country with more gold medals should come first.
  - If there is a tie in the no. of gold medals, the country with more silver medals should come first.
  - If there is a tie in the no. of silver medals, the country with more bronze medals should come first.
  - If there is a tie in the no. of bronze medals as well, then the countries with the tie are sorted in ascending order lexicographically.

### Explanation:
  - The tie between China and USA is broken by their lexicographical names.
  - Since "China" is lexicographically smaller than "USA", it comes first.
  - Israel comes before Egypt because it has more bronze medals.
